# Non-Targeted-Adversarial-Attacks

## Introduction
This repository contains the code for the top-1 submission to [NIPS 2017: Non-targeted Adversarial Attacks Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nips-2017-non-targeted-adversarial-attack).

## Method
We propose a momentum iterative method to generate more transferable adversarial examples. We summarize our algorithm in [Boosting Adversarial Attacks with Momentum](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.06081.pdf) (CVPR 2018, Spotlight).

Basically, the update rule of momentum iterative method is:

## Implementation

### Models
We use the ensemble of eight models in our submission, many of which are adversarially trained models. The models can be downloaded [here](http://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~yinpeng/nips17/nontargeted/models.zip).

If you want to attack other models, you can replace the model definition part to your own models.

### Cleverhans
We also implement this method in [Cleverhans](https://github.com/tensorflow/cleverhans/blob/master/cleverhans/attacks.py#L454-L605).
